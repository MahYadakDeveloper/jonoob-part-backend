  /**
   * Handles a multipart/form-data request.
   *
   * This endpoint expects uploaded files and will consume them using
   * Fastify's multipart API (e.g. `await req.file()` or `req.parts()`).
   *
   * Prerequisite:
   * The `@fastify/multipart` plugin must be registered during application
   * bootstrap. Otherwise, multipart APIs will not be available on the request
   * object and this endpoint will fail at runtime.
   *
   * Note:
   * `req` is intentionally typed as `any` because Fastify augments the request
   * object with multipart methods via plugin registration rather than static
   * typings. Refer to the Fastify Request documentation for the available APIs.
